# MakeChangeProject

# Description
This project simulates a cash register. 

# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse IDE, git

# Lessons Learned
- practiced using modulus operator
- learned to be careful in testing i.e. not just testing obvious cases
- figured out a way to end the program if the user input is bad

# Things I Tried to Work On
- structuring the program using methods to break up tasks
- converting different types of numbers (testing, rounding)
- testing for bad user input
- practiced carefully reading the problem and start by describing algorithms in words, putting these as comments and then building
  up the project in small pieces, testing incrementally
