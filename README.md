# MakeChangeProject

# Description
This project simulates a cash register. 

# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse IDE, git

# Lessons Learned
- practiced using modulus operator
- learned to be careful in testing i.e. not just testing obvious cases
- figured out a way to end the program if the user input is bad
- getting the text to match quantities (commas, plurals) is a real pain

# Things I Tried to Work On
- structuring the program using methods to break up tasks
- converting different types of numbers (testing, rounding)
- testing for bad user input
- practiced carefully reading the problem and start by describing algorithms in words, putting these as comments and then building
  up the project in small pieces, testing incrementally
- did project without using any built in methods

# Problems/Bugs/Things I Would Change...
- no way to handle type mismatch error of scanner (like if user enters a string)
- would add a loop if I could catch this error to keep going until good input
- would add a loop so program could run again
